: hello-world
helena's first respository for school projects

Ok so the document tells me to write abit about myself: So just because someone may read this (Who knows it could happen), I will.
I am an older IT professional returning to study to find out what I have missed out on. This is a passion of mine, my actual job is Testing, but looking forward to the web development course I signed up for over summer school 2017 /2018 at Massey University.
